# Facebook chatbot

This is a simple chatbot that replies to the most recent unread message. The message is hardcoded.

The reason why I built this was I'm receiving Facebook messages, but I don't even use Facebook because of that I wanted 
to inform people who text me on Facebook that I don't use Facebook and contact me from other social networks.
